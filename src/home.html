                Plastic pollution is one of the most dangerous consequences the world is facing today. 
                We have been using plastic day-to-day for many reasons. 
                We use plastic bags, plastic containers, plastic bottles, plastic toys and so on. 
                All of these do make our lives easier, but the more we use plastic and dispose of it into 
                the environment, the more are the risks involved. </p>
                <p>
                It is our responsibility to let people know about the harmful effects of plastic pollution, 
                and writing slogans on plastic pollution will help get the word out to an extent.
            </p>

                <h2>Ways to Reduce Your Plastic Consumption</h2>
                <ul>

                        <p>
                            <strong>Carry Your Grocery Bag – </strong>One of the largest consumptions of plastic bags are at grocery stores. 
                            Next time you go out to buy fruits and vegetables, take a cloth or jute bag along with you.
                             Ask your vegetable seller to put the veggies inside your bag instead of the polyethene. 
                        </p>
                    </li>

                        <strong>It is Time to Recycle – </strong>We Indians are known to have a big plastic bag to store other plastic bags in it! 
                            This is a good practice to reuse them. 
                            Reuse and recycle the plastic bags that you have at home. 
                        </p>

                        <strong>Click on ‘No Cutlery’ –</strong> While ordering online food, remember to click on the ‘don not send cutlery’ 
                            option just before you confirm your order. Most of the restaurants these days have this option. 
                            By doing this you can order with no plastic cutlery!
